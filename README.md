# BPL_Interpreter

This program is an interpreter for the 
Bobcat Programming language (a simple syntaxed language created by Professor Abukamail). 
It reads in each line of the file, tokenizes it using the scan function (bpl_scanner.py). 
It then evaluates and executes these tokens. The value of any expression is found using 
evaluate (bpl_expressions.py). This program should be ran using python 3.X, running the 
interpreter.py file with the Bobcate Programming Language file as a command line argument.
